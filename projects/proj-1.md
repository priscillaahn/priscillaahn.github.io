title: 'Lab One: Knightlab Timeline'
---

For this project, we had to use the Knight Lab Foundation Timeline application to tell a chronological story.
During my summer internship with UNOSAT, I had to monitor the controversial filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam over time.
This lab was the perfect opportunity to research the background geopolitical conflict surrounding the dam that made it so controversial.
